# HTMLtoPDF
I like to send some articles to readitlater or other similar services, but sometimes I want a pdf of an article.

###Usage
Ugh right now you have to rename and config_example.py to config.py and insert correct values
Other than that it does not even function very well

###Dependencies
* pdfkit `pip install pdfkit`
* wkhtmltopdf which is required by pdfkit. To install go to http://wkhtmltopdf.org/
* requests `pip install requests`
